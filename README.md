## Abstract

This nifty assignment is designed to introduce students to fundamental networking concepts, such as the client---server model, sockets, and network protocols, through hands-on experience with cross-language programming and code refactoring. The assignment targets students without a prior background in computer science. By engaging students with starter code in C, Python, and Java, the assignment facilitates the understanding of protocols across different programming languages and emphasizes the importance of code reusability and refactoring. Students are tasked with extending server functionality to include custom commands and are encouraged to use AI tools for code development. This approach aims to prepare students for the evolving pedagogical landscape where AI-assisted development plays a significant role in software engineering practices.
